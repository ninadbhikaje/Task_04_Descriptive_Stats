# Task_04_Descriptive_Stats

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project performs descriptive statistical analysis on 3 different datasets such as political ad data, facebook posts data and twitter data from the **2024 U.S. Presidential Election**,  using ** Pure Python's standard library** (no external dependencies), **Pandas** and **Polars**. The analysis includes the descriptive statistics of all three dataset's numerical and categorical columns.

## ðŸš€ How to Run the Code

1. **Make sure you have Python 3.x installed**.

2. **Place the dataset** in a known directory (e.g., `Downloads/period_03/`).

3. **Update the file path** in the script if needed:

   For example: ```python 
   filepath = 'C://Users//your_name//Downloads//period_03//2024_fb_ads_president_scored_anon.csv'


## Summary of findings or interesting insights

1.	Facebook ads dataset results
The script computes:
â€¢	Overall descriptive stats for the column estimated_spend
o	Count, Mean, Min, Max, Standard Deviation
â€¢	Top 10 most frequent entries in the bylines (campaign source) column
â€¢	Grouped statistics by page_id (aggregating spend data per page)
Interesting Insights
â€¢	The dataset contains 246,745 valid ad spend records.
â€¢	The average ad spend per entry was around $1,061, but varied widely (up to $474,999).
â€¢	Top campaign sources by ad count include:
o	HARRIS FOR PRESIDENT â€“ 49,788 entries
o	HARRIS VICTORY FUND â€“ 32,612 entries
o	DONALD J. TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT 2024, INC. â€“ 15,112 entries
â€¢	Some page_id groups had very consistent spend patterns, including pages with standard $49 spends and zero standard deviation.
